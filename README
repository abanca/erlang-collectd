Erlang-Collectd
===============

Branch by NCG Moviles
Forked from: amanciodiaz/erlang-collectd
Forked from: astro/erlang-collectd

This app sends data to a collectd server.

Changes from original sources:

* Added basic rebar support
* Patch for sending only one value per UDP packet
* Patch for using node name instead Hostname. This way we got application statistics and not machine statistics.
